- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Clodo.
- ðŸ‘€ I'm mostly interested in computer science and physics, but Iâ€™m constantly attracted towards all sort of subjects (and not only merely through gravitation).
- I'm currently learning Javascript and Python and I'm always trying to come up with challenging projects so I can improve my skils.  
- C# and game engines are in my plans, as I've been always very into video-games and want to enter the world of game development at some point.
