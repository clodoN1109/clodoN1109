- 😜 Hi, I’m Clodo.
- 👀🪐👨🏽‍💻 I'm mostly interested in computer science and physics, but I’m constantly attracted towards all sort of subjects (and not only merely through gravitation).
- 📚 I'm currently learning Javascript and Python and I'm always coming up with ideias to challenge my skils.  
- 🕹️ C# and game engines are in my plans, as I've been always into video-games and want to enter the world of game development.
